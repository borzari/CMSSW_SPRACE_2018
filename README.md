# Introduction
In this branch i'll include some commands really importants in Linux, SSH and Github.

## Linux

The `pwd` is a very useful command, this shows the folder as you stay. E. g. if you are in the folder Desktop this command will return:

`/home/user/Desktop`




## SSH
The SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol that provides administrators with a secure way to access a remote computer. SSH also refers to the suite of utilities that implement the protocol. Secure Shell provides strong authentication and secure encrypted data communications between two computers connecting over an insecure network such as the Internet. SSH is widely used by network administrators for managing systems and applications remotely, allowing them to log in to another computer over a network, execute commands and move files from one computer to another.

To access the SPRACE Cluster use:

`ssh -XY user@access.sprace.org.br`

To access the LXplus use:

`ssh -XY user@lxplus.cern.ch`




## GitHub
